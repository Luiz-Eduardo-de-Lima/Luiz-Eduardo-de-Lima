- 👋 Hi, I’m Luiz Eduardo, I'm from Brazil and I'm studying Economics at the University.
- 👀 I’m interested in Scientific Computing, Statistics, Econometrics, Math and Data Science (I shouldn't forget about Linux, but maybe this is regular between those interested in programming)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R, but I want to go back to beginning and study Algothims and Data Structure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on economical research.
